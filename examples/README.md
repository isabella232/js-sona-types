# Examples

In this directory we have two examples of how to consume this library, one via a node.js simple example, and one via a create-react-app based example.

You will need the project built before you do these examples, as both rely on the built code existing in the `../dist/` directory.

## NodeJS Example

To run the NodeJS example:

- `cd node && yarn && yarn start`

If all goes well, you'll see a response like this:

```
examples/node $ yarn start                                                                 334ms  Thu May 13 21:10:37 2021
yarn run v1.22.10
$ node -r esm index.js

## React example

To run the React example:

- `cd react-test-app && yarn && yarn start`

This should load the react app in the browser, and in the console info in Dev Tools, you should see the response from OSS Index logged.

### Disclaimer

These projects were generated by us just to ensure that we packaged our library appropriately to where it can be imported and used in both node and the browser. We likely did some things wrong! If we did, send us a PR!
