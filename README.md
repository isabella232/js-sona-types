Hi, hello! This library is mostly for consumption by Sonatype projects that need a common way to talk to OSS Index, Nexus IQ, and etc...

## Development

To get started you'll need node, yarn, and that's about it!

### Building

- `yarn`
- `yarn build`

### Examples

In the `/examples` dir, there is a README that has examples of how to test that the project is working for both node, and React. Go browse there for more information!
